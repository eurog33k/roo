# Roo
The reference command line interpreter for the Roo programming language

## The Roo programming language
Roo is a cross-platform dynamically-typed interpreted open source scripting language which takes inspiration from Ruby (everything is an object) and Python (indentation is important). It supports both object-oriented and functional programming approaches. The reference interpreter is `roo` which is written in [Xojo][xojo].
